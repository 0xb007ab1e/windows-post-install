# windows-post-install.bat

This batch script automatically installs the programs I use in my PC, runs updates and apply some personal preferences.

Works fine on **Windows 10** & **Windows 11**.

#
### How to use
* Define the programs to be installed in file "applist.txt" by it's "winget ID". 
* In case you don't know the ID of an app, use `winget search <appname>` on terminal.
* Always run the .bat file as admin.
