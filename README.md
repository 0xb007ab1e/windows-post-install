# windows-post-install.bat

This batch script automatically installs all programs I use in my PC, runs updates and apply some personal preferences.
Works fine on Windows 11. Some adjustments will be made for working on Windows 10 as well.

### How to use
* Just download and run the .bat file as admin.
